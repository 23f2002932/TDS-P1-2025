# AI Developer Bot - TDS Project 1

This project is an autonomous agent capable of building, deploying, and updating single-page web applications based on a given brief. It leverages an LLM for code generation and the GitHub API for automated deployment to GitHub Pages. This project was developed as part of the TDS Project-1 curriculum.

## Features

-   **ðŸ¤– Automated Build:** Receives a JSON request with an application brief, uses an LLM to generate the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
-   **ðŸš€ Automated Deployment:** Programmatically creates a new public GitHub repository, pushes the generated code, and enables GitHub Pages to make the application live.
-   **ðŸ”„ Automated Revision:** Handles a second request to fetch the existing code, modify it based on a new brief, and redeploy the updated application to the same GitHub Pages site.

## API Endpoint

The server listens for POST requests on a single endpoint to handle all tasks.

-   **URL:** `/handle_task`
-   **Method:** `POST`
-   **Body:** The request body must be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "email": "student@example.com",
  "secret": "your_shared_secret",
  "task": "unique-task-name",
  "round": 1,
  "nonce": "unique-nonce-string",
  "brief": "A natural language description of the application to build or modify.",
  "checks": [],
  "evaluation_url": "https://example.com/evaluation_endpoint",
  "attachments": []
}
```
